# FEM-Sign-in--form
My first frontend mentor challenge the requires js.

Things i learnt working on this project;
- Created my first form. 
- I learnt to use "required" to ensure the input is filled by the user before it can be submitted. 
- I learnt how to manipulate styles and attribute using js. 
- I implemented sass for the first time. (Sass makes styling cleaner and more efficient).

Things I could have done to make the project better;
- Use regex to check that the input field follow the right format. E.g Check if password is alphanumeric. 
- Make the "Claim free trial button look active after user fills form correctly.
